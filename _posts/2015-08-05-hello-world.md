Good morning, everybody.

We started to publish our technical information, such as about a new feature of our product, development tips and bugfixes on this technical blog.

Let us talk about our main product. The service name is "Linkage", that will support lots of service integrations and manage one or more projects to help your project management in many situations.

We are developing Linkage with new technologies containing WebComponents and Elixir. So we face many problems, such as how to assgin roles for each custom element, bind on Backbone classes from Polymer element, implement back-end system with Phoenix Framework, solve library bugs and so on...

The technical blog mainly accumulates these tips. But another information will be published on this!

Nice to meet you and thanks for reading :)
